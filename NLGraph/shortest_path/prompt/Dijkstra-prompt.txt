We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two given nodes in an undirected weighted graph.
The basic idea is:
1. Start at the source node with distance 0, and set all other nodes' distances to infinity.
2. Mark all nodes as unvisited. Set the source node as current.
3. For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node.
4. When done considering all neighbors of the current node, mark it as visited.
5. Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new current node.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the destination node is visited.
7. Backtrack from the destination to the source to get the shortest path.

In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are:
an edge between node 0 and node 1 with weight 2,
an edge between node 1 and node 4 with weight 1,
an edge between node 0 and node 2 with weight 1,
an edge between node 2 and node 3 with weight 1,
an edge between node 3 and node 4 with weight 2.
Q: Give the shortest path from node 0 to node 4.
A: Using Dijkstra's algorithm:
Step 1: Start at node 0 with distance 0. Distances: {0:0, 1:∞, 2:∞, 3:∞, 4:∞}
Step 2: From node 0, update neighbors: node 1 (distance 2), node 2 (distance 1). Distances: {0:0, 1:2, 2:1, 3:∞, 4:∞}
Step 3: Visit node 2 (smallest unvisited distance 1). From node 2, update neighbor node 3 (distance 1+1=2). Distances: {0:0, 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 4:∞}
Step 4: Visit node 1 (distance 2). From node 1, update neighbor node 4 (distance 2+1=3). Distances: {0:0, 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 4:3}
Step 5: Visit node 3 (distance 2). From node 3, node 4 already has distance 3, update would be 2+2=4, so no update.
Step 6: Visit node 4 (distance 3). Destination reached.
