In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 19, and the edges are:
an edge between node 0 and node 4 with weight 7,
an edge between node 0 and node 11 with weight 5,
an edge between node 1 and node 7 with weight 2,
an edge between node 1 and node 15 with weight 8,
an edge between node 1 and node 5 with weight 6,
an edge between node 2 and node 19 with weight 8,
an edge between node 2 and node 11 with weight 9,
an edge between node 2 and node 9 with weight 4,
an edge between node 3 and node 16 with weight 1,
an edge between node 3 and node 15 with weight 9,
an edge between node 3 and node 8 with weight 6,
an edge between node 3 and node 13 with weight 8,
an edge between node 3 and node 14 with weight 8,
an edge between node 4 and node 5 with weight 8,
an edge between node 5 and node 7 with weight 5,
an edge between node 5 and node 15 with weight 9,
an edge between node 6 and node 11 with weight 8,
an edge between node 6 and node 8 with weight 2,
an edge between node 6 and node 17 with weight 6,
an edge between node 6 and node 13 with weight 5,
an edge between node 7 and node 18 with weight 3,
an edge between node 7 and node 19 with weight 8,
an edge between node 7 and node 13 with weight 4,
an edge between node 8 and node 12 with weight 2,
an edge between node 8 and node 9 with weight 1,
an edge between node 8 and node 14 with weight 2,
an edge between node 9 and node 16 with weight 6,
an edge between node 9 and node 11 with weight 5,
an edge between node 10 and node 12 with weight 8,
an edge between node 10 and node 13 with weight 4,
an edge between node 10 and node 14 with weight 3,
an edge between node 12 and node 17 with weight 9,
an edge between node 15 and node 19 with weight 2,
an edge between node 17 and node 18 with weight 9.
Q: Give the shortest path from node 12 to node 4.
A: Let's solve the problem by a Python program:

Please provide your answer in the following format:
the shortest path from node 12 to node 4 is [list the nodes separated by commas] with total length [number].

IMPORTANT: For the total length, provide ONLY the final number (e.g., 'with total length 34'), NOT a calculation expression (e.g., do NOT write 'with total length 1 + 7 + 5 + 2 + 19 = 34'). Please provide your answer in plain text format (no markdown, no bold, no special formatting).
